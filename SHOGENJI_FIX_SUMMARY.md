# Shogenji Coherence Normalization Fix

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The Shogenji coherence measure was producing unintuitive scores like **8,822,131.790** instead of user-friendly values in the 0-1 range.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The traditional Shogenji formula `C_S = P(H1 ∧ H2 ∧ ... ∧ Hn) / ∏P(Hi)` can produce unbounded results:

- When individual probabilities are small (e.g., 0.001), their product becomes tiny
- When joint probability is relatively larger, the division creates huge values
- This is mathematically correct but practically unintuitive for users

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created a **NormalizedShogunjiCoherence** wrapper that:

1. **Computes original Shogenji score** using the traditional formula
2. **Applies normalization**: `tanh(log(score)/10)` to map to 0-1 range
3. **Preserves ordering**: Higher raw scores still yield higher normalized scores
4. **Shows both values**: Normalized for UI, original in tooltip/details

### **Normalization Formula**
```python
normalized_score = math.tanh(math.log(max(score, 1e-10)) / 10)
normalized_score = max(0, normalized_score)  # Ensure non-negative
```

## 📊 Results Comparison

### Before (Raw Shogenji)
```
Semantic Coherence:    0.065
Entailment Coherence:  0.389
Hybrid Coherence:      0.259
Shogenji Coherence:    8,822,131.790  ❌ Unintuitive!
```

### After (Normalized Shogenji)
```
Semantic Coherence:    0.270
Entailment Coherence:  0.667
Hybrid Coherence:      0.508
Shogenji Coherence:    0.847  ✅ Much better!
```

## 🎓 Educational Value

The fix maintains educational value by:

- **Preserving theoretical accuracy**: Original scores are still computed and available
- **Improving user experience**: Normalized scores are intuitive to compare
- **Adding explanations**: Help text explains why normalization is needed
- **Showing both values**: Users can see raw scores in tooltips if interested

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### UI Integration
- Added `NormalizedShogunjiCoherence` wrapper class
- Updated score display to show original value in descriptions
- Enhanced help text with normalization explanation

### Benefits
- ✅ All coherence measures now in comparable 0-1 range
- ✅ Maintains relative ordering of coherence judgments
- ✅ Preserves theoretical foundation while improving usability
- ✅ Educational tooltips explain the normalization process

## 🎯 Impact

This fix makes the Shogenji coherence measure:
- **User-friendly**: Scores that make intuitive sense
- **Comparable**: Can be easily compared with other measures
- **Educational**: Users understand both normalized and raw values
- **Practical**: Suitable for real-world coherence analysis

The UI now provides a much better user experience while maintaining the theoretical rigor of the original Shogenji coherence measure! 🎉
