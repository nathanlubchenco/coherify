## Documentation Categories

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Reference/Historical)
These documents describe completed work, historical context, or stable references:

1. **CRITICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md** - Describes what was wrong and how it was fixed
2. **CRITICAL_METHODOLOGY_FIX.md** - Documents the fix to the 3-stage pipeline approach
3. **REAL_DATA_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md** - Actual benchmark results with real API data
4. **BENCHMARK_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of all benchmark-related fixes
5. **CODE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of code cleanup efforts
6. **IMPLEMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - List of implemented improvements
7. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Overall implementation summary
8. **LEGACY_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Historical context and lessons learned
9. **BENCHMARK_REFERENCES.md** - Stable reference for benchmark papers/code
10. **OPENAI_MODELS.md** - OpenAI model documentation (reference)
11. **benchmarks/*.md** - Individual benchmark READMEs from source repos

### üîÑ IN_PROGRESS (Active Work)
Documents currently being updated or representing active work:

1. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Continuously updated with new issues/solutions
2. **MODEL_CONFIGURATION.md** - Being updated as we add new models

### üìã BACKLOG (Future Work)
Documents representing future work or needing updates:

1. **MULTI_FORMAT_BENCHMARKS.md** - Needs implementation of multi-format support
2. **OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md** - Needs updates for deployment procedures
3. **LINTING_AND_FORMATTING.md** - Need to implement proper linting setup
4. **benchmark_compatibility.md** - Needs rewrite as pipeline methodology doc

### ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED (On Hold)
Documents for features/work temporarily on hold:

1. **BENCHMARK_METHODOLOGY_AUDIT.md** - Audit complete, may need future review

## Categorization Rationale

### Why "Completed"
- Documents describing finished work (fixes, summaries)
- Historical/reference documents (legacy architecture, model docs)
- Stable references (benchmark papers, external READMEs)

### Why "In Progress"
- Documents actively being updated (troubleshooting)
- Documents needing regular updates (model configuration)

### Why "Backlog"
- Documents for unimplemented features (multi-format)
- Documents needing significant rewrites (benchmark_compatibility)
- Documents for incomplete setup (linting)

### Why "Paused"
- Work that was started but put on hold (methodology audit)

## Next Steps
1. Move documents to appropriate directories
2. Add timestamps to document headers
3. Create process for moving docs between categories
4. Set up regular review cycle
