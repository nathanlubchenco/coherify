# Coherify Research Approach

## Core Research Question

**How can coherence theory improve response selection in multi-generation scenarios for better factual accuracy?**

## Three-Stage Research Pipeline

### Stage 1: Official Baselines ✅
- Faithfully reproduce benchmark evaluation methods
- Validate against published results
- Benchmarks: TruthfulQA (GPT-judge/BLEURT), FEVER (official scorer), SelfCheckGPT (BERTScore)
- **Purpose**: Establish that our implementations are correct

### Stage 2: K-Pass Majority Voting Baseline 
- Generate K responses per question/prompt
- Use simple majority voting to determine final answer
- This becomes our **fair comparison baseline** for coherence methods
- **Purpose**: Standard ensemble approach that coherence must beat

### Stage 3: Coherence-Enhanced Response Selection (Our Contribution)
- Generate K responses per question at multiple temperatures  
- Apply coherence measures to select/weight responses intelligently
- **Key Insight**: Truth is more likely to appear consistently across temperature variations
- **Purpose**: Show coherence beats naive majority voting

## Research Hypothesis

**Coherent responses across multiple generations (especially at different temperatures) are more likely to be factually accurate than responses selected by simple majority voting.**

## Implementation Approach

### K-Pass Majority Voting
```python
# Generate K responses
responses = [model.generate(prompt, temp=0.7) for _ in range(K)]

# Simple majority vote
final_answer = majority_vote(responses)
```

### Coherence-Enhanced Selection
```python
# Generate K responses at multiple temperatures
responses = []
for temp in [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]:
    responses.extend([model.generate(prompt, temp=temp) for _ in range(K//4)])

# Apply coherence measures
coherence_scores = [coherence_measure.compute(response) for response in responses]

# Selection strategies (to explore):
# 1. Most coherent single response
best_response = responses[np.argmax(coherence_scores)]

# 2. Coherence-weighted voting (future work)
weights = softmax(coherence_scores)
final_answer = weighted_vote(responses, weights)

# 3. Coherence filtering + majority vote (future work)
high_coherence = [r for r, c in zip(responses, coherence_scores) if c > threshold]
final_answer = majority_vote(high_coherence)
```

## Key Insights to Validate

1. **Temperature Consistency**: More truthful content appears consistently across temperatures
2. **Coherence Signal**: Coherent responses correlate with factual accuracy  
3. **Ensemble Enhancement**: Coherence-based selection beats majority voting
4. **Randomness Exploitation**: Temperature variation provides signal, not just noise

## Experimental Design

### Fair Comparisons
- **Single Generation**: Standard baseline (temp=0.7)
- **K-Pass Majority**: K generations with majority vote (temp=0.7) 
- **Coherence Enhanced**: K generations with coherence selection (multiple temps)

### Metrics
- Official benchmark scores (truthfulness, FEVER score, AUC-PR)
- Improvement over single generation
- Improvement over K-pass majority voting
- Analysis by temperature variation

### Research Questions
1. Does K-pass majority voting improve over single generation?
2. Does coherence selection improve over K-pass majority voting?  
3. Which coherence measures work best for response selection?
4. Does temperature variation provide useful signal?
5. How does performance scale with K?

## Future Extensions

### Temperature Variation as Primary Contribution
- If temperature variation provides most of the benefit
- Study optimal temperature ranges and distributions
- Compare fixed vs. adaptive temperature selection

### Advanced Selection Strategies  
- Coherence-weighted voting across responses
- Multi-stage filtering (coherence + majority vote)
- Learning optimal combination weights
- Confidence-based selection thresholds

### Response Quality Analysis
- What makes responses more/less coherent?
- Correlation between coherence and factual accuracy
- Analysis of failure modes and edge cases

## Success Criteria

1. **Reproduction**: Official baselines match published results (±3%)
2. **K-Pass Improvement**: Majority voting improves over single generation
3. **Coherence Enhancement**: Coherence selection beats majority voting by meaningful margin
4. **Consistency**: Results hold across multiple benchmarks (TruthfulQA, FEVER, SelfCheckGPT)

## Research Contributions

1. **Methodological**: Rigorous evaluation framework with proper baselines
2. **Empirical**: Quantified benefits of coherence for response selection
3. **Theoretical**: Insights into relationship between coherence, temperature, and factual accuracy
4. **Practical**: Deployable methods for improving LLM factual accuracy through better ensemble techniques

This positions coherence theory as a **practical tool for improving LLM reliability** rather than just a philosophical concept.
