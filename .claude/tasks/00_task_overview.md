## Critical Path Analysis

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Task 01: Fix Test Suite** - BLOCKS all other development
- 38/95 tests failing prevents reliable development
- Must complete before any feature work

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 2) 
**Task 07: Proposition Extraction** - ENABLES accurate evaluation
- Currently naive sentence splitting undermines all coherence measures
- Required for meaningful benchmark results
- Foundational for objectives 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

### Phase 3: Primary Objectives (Week 3)
**Task 02: Benchmark Replication** - Validates implementation
- First concrete deliverable toward objective 1
- Baseline for all subsequent improvements

**Parallel Development:**
- Task 03: Majority Voting (Objective 2)
- Task 04: Temperature Coherence (Objective 3) 

### Phase 4: Extensions (Week 4)
**Parallel Development:**
- Task 05: Additional Measures (Objective 4)
- Task 06: Additional Benchmarks (Objective 5)

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ with ML dependencies (torch, transformers, sentence-transformers)
- spaCy with English model for proposition extraction  
- API keys for OpenAI/Anthropic (optional, for enhanced features)
- 8-16GB RAM for ML model loading

### External Dependencies
- Hugging Face datasets for benchmark data
- Wikipedia API for knowledge grounding (Task 06)
- Fact-checking APIs (optional, Task 06)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Task 01 complexity**: Test failures may indicate deeper architectural issues
- **Task 07 performance**: Sophisticated proposition extraction may be too slow
- **Data availability**: Some benchmarks may not be easily accessible

### Medium Risk  
- **API rate limits**: Enhanced features depend on external APIs
- **Model dependencies**: Large ML models may cause memory/performance issues
- **Integration complexity**: Connecting all components may reveal unexpected issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- Implement fallback methods for all external dependencies
- Add performance monitoring and optimization from the start
- Create comprehensive testing for all new components

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >95% test pass rate, >80% code coverage
- **Performance**: <5s per sample evaluation, <1GB memory usage
- **Accuracy**: Coherence scores correlate with human judgment
- **Reliability**: No failures on standard benchmark datasets

### Research Metrics  
- **Replication**: Successfully replicate known benchmark results
- **Improvement**: K-run voting shows measurable accuracy gains
- **Insights**: Temperature analysis reveals coherence-performance trade-offs
- **Extensibility**: New measures provide complementary evaluation

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Critical Foundation
Focus exclusively on Task 01 (Fix Test Suite) to unblock development.

### Week 2: Core Infrastructure  
Implement Task 07 (Proposition Extraction) as foundation for all evaluation.
Begin Task 02 (Benchmark Replication) validation.

### Week 3: Primary Objectives
Complete Task 02 and implement Tasks 03-04 in parallel.
Validate all primary objectives are achievable.

### Week 4: Extensions and Polish
Implement Tasks 05-06 based on remaining time and priorities.
Focus on documentation and reproducibility.
