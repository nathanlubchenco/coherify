# Uncertainty Detection Framework Task

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive uncertainty detection system that uses coherence measures to identify when AI models are uncertain, unreliable, or likely to produce hallucinations.

## Background
Current AI systems often express high confidence even when producing incorrect or hallucinated responses. A coherence-based uncertainty detection framework would:
- Identify when models are uncertain about their responses
- Flag potential hallucinations before they reach users
- Provide calibrated confidence scores for AI predictions
- Enable "I don't know" responses when appropriate

## Core Components

### 1. Uncertainty Detection Framework
```python
class UncertaintyDetector:
    """Detect uncertainty and potential hallucinations using coherence analysis."""
    
    def __init__(self, coherence_measures: List[CoherenceMeasure], config: UncertaintyConfig):
        self.coherence_measures = coherence_measures
        self.config = config
        self.uncertainty_classifiers = {}
    
    def detect_uncertainty(self, responses: List[str], context: str) -> UncertaintyResult:
        """Analyze responses for uncertainty indicators."""
        pass
    
    def calibrate_confidence(self, response: str, coherence_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
        """Convert coherence scores to calibrated confidence."""
        pass
```

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Uncertainty Analysis
- **Response Coherence**: Internal consistency within single responses
- **Multi-Response Variance**: Inconsistency across multiple generations
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: How much responses change with temperature
- **Context Coherence**: Consistency with provided context/evidence
- **Knowledge Boundaries**: Detection of out-of-distribution queries

### 3. Hallucination Detection
```python
class HallucinationDetector:
    """Specialized detector for factual hallucinations."""
    
    def detect_factual_inconsistency(self, claim: str, context: str) -> HallucinationResult:
        """Detect potential factual hallucinations."""
        pass
    
    def detect_self_contradiction(self, response: str) -> List[Contradiction]:
        """Find internal contradictions within responses."""
        pass
```

### 4. Confidence Calibration
- **Coherence-Confidence Mapping**: Learn relationship between coherence and accuracy
- **Task-Specific Calibration**: Different calibration for different task types
- **Bayesian Confidence**: Principled uncertainty quantification
- **Human Alignment**: Calibrate to match human uncertainty judgments

## Technical Specifications

### Uncertainty Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class UncertaintyConfig:
    """Configuration for uncertainty detection."""
    coherence_threshold: float = 0.4           # Below this, flag as uncertain
    variance_threshold: float = 0.3            # Multi-response variance threshold
    temperature_sensitivity: float = 0.2       # Temperature change threshold
    hallucination_threshold: float = 0.6       # Factual inconsistency threshold
    confidence_calibration_method: str = "platt"  # "platt", "isotonic", "bayesian"
    enable_self_contradiction: bool = True     # Check for internal contradictions
    context_weight: float = 0.3               # Weight of context coherence
    require_evidence: bool = False             # Require evidence for factual claims
```

### Uncertainty Result Format
```python
@dataclass
class UncertaintyResult:
    """Result from uncertainty detection analysis."""
    is_uncertain: bool                         # Overall uncertainty flag
    confidence_score: float                    # Calibrated confidence (0-1)
    uncertainty_reasons: List[str]             # Specific uncertainty indicators
    coherence_scores: Dict[str, float]         # Individual coherence measures
    hallucination_risk: float                 # Risk of factual hallucination
    self_contradictions: List[Contradiction]   # Internal contradictions found
    temperature_sensitivity: float            # Response variation with temperature
    knowledge_boundary_flags: List[str]       # Out-of-distribution indicators
    recommended_action: str                   # "accept", "flag", "reject", "seek_evidence"
```

### Hallucination Detection
```python
@dataclass
class HallucinationResult:
    """Result from hallucination detection."""
    hallucination_detected: bool               # Binary hallucination flag
    hallucination_type: str                   # "factual", "logical", "contextual"
    confidence: float                         # Confidence in hallucination detection
    problematic_claims: List[str]             # Specific claims flagged
    evidence_contradictions: List[str]        # Claims contradicting evidence
    factual_consistency_score: float         # Overall factual consistency
```

## Detection Methods

### 1. Multi-Response Uncertainty
```python
def detect_response_variance(responses: List[str]) -> float:
    """Measure uncertainty through response variance."""
    # Generate multiple responses at different temperatures
    # Measure semantic similarity between responses
    # High variance = high uncertainty
    pass
```

### 2. Coherence-Based Confidence
```python
def coherence_to_confidence(coherence_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
    """Convert coherence scores to calibrated confidence."""
    # Weighted combination of multiple coherence measures
    # Learned mapping from coherence to accuracy
    # Task-specific calibration
    pass
```

### 3. Self-Contradiction Detection
```python
def detect_contradictions(response: str) -> List[Contradiction]:
    """Find internal contradictions within response."""
    # Parse response into claims
    # Check for logical contradictions
    # Check for factual contradictions
    # Return specific contradiction pairs
    pass
```

### 4. Knowledge Boundary Detection
```python
def detect_knowledge_boundaries(query: str, response: str) -> List[str]:
    """Detect when query is outside model's knowledge."""
    # Check for domain-specific knowledge indicators
    # Detect temporal knowledge cutoffs
    # Identify specialized domain queries
    # Flag uncertainty when outside known boundaries
    pass
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Production AI Assistants
```python
# Real-time uncertainty detection for user queries
detector = UncertaintyDetector(measures=[HybridCoherence(), EvidenceBasedCoherence()])

response = model.generate("What is the capital of the newly formed country Zorptopia?")
uncertainty = detector.detect_uncertainty([response], context="Geography question")

if uncertainty.is_uncertain:
    return "I'm not confident about this answer. Let me search for more recent information."
else:
    return response
```

### 2. Fact-Checking Systems
```python
# Detect hallucinations in fact-checking
hallucination_detector = HallucinationDetector()

claim = "Albert Einstein invented the telephone in 1876."
result = hallucination_detector.detect_factual_inconsistency(claim, historical_context)

if result.hallucination_detected:
    return f"Factual inconsistency detected: {result.problematic_claims}"
```

### 3. Educational Applications
```python
# Uncertainty-aware tutoring system
tutor_detector = UncertaintyDetector(config=UncertaintyConfig(
    confidence_calibration_method="bayesian",
    require_evidence=True
))

student_question = "How do black holes work?"
answer = educational_model.generate(student_question)
uncertainty = tutor_detector.detect_uncertainty([answer], context="Physics education")

if uncertainty.confidence_score < 0.7:
    return answer + "\n\nNote: This is a complex topic. I recommend checking additional sources."
```
