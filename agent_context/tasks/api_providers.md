Add support for accessing the latest openAI and Anthropic models via api calls.  For now allow api keys to be read locally from environment variables.  Make sure to support the slightly different reasoning apis that openAI uses for models like o3.  Look up latest documentation as needed or let me know if you need it provided.

The goal is to eventually run the benchmarks with these external models via api calls rather than a much smaller model running locally.
