# Temporal Coherence Framework Task

## Overview
Implement temporal coherence evaluation for time-sensitive claims and knowledge that changes over time. This addresses a critical gap in current AI evaluation by handling the temporal dimension of factual accuracy and reasoning consistency.

## Background
Current AI evaluation treats all claims as temporally static, but many facts change over time:
- "Who is the President?" depends on when asked
- "Is Pluto a planet?" changed classification in 2006  
- "What is the population of China?" continuously changes
- Scientific knowledge evolves with new discoveries

A temporal coherence framework would evaluate AI systems' ability to maintain coherent reasoning about time-sensitive information.

## Core Components

### 1. Temporal Coherence Framework
```python
class TemporalCoherenceEvaluator:
    """Evaluate coherence of time-sensitive claims and reasoning."""
    
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base: TemporalKnowledgeBase, coherence_measure: CoherenceMeasure):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base
        self.coherence_measure = coherence_measure
        self.temporal_patterns = {}
    
    def evaluate_temporal_consistency(self, claim: str, time_context: TimeContext) -> TemporalResult:
        """Evaluate if claim is consistent with temporal context."""
        pass
    
    def detect_temporal_conflicts(self, claims: List[TimedClaim]) -> List[TemporalConflict]:
        """Find conflicts between time-sensitive claims."""
        pass
```

### 2. Time-Aware Knowledge Representation
```python
@dataclass
class TimedClaim:
    """Claim with temporal validity information."""
    claim: str
    valid_from: Optional[datetime]
    valid_until: Optional[datetime]
    confidence: float
    temporal_scope: str  # "instant", "period", "ongoing", "eternal"
    
@dataclass  
class TimeContext:
    """Context for temporal evaluation."""
    reference_time: datetime
    time_scope: str  # "specific", "range", "relative"
    temporal_granularity: str  # "year", "month", "day", "hour"
    knowledge_cutoff: Optional[datetime]
```

### 3. Temporal Reasoning Evaluation
- **Before/After Consistency**: Claims about events in temporal sequence
- **Causality Coherence**: Cause-effect relationships over time
- **State Change Tracking**: How entities change properties over time
- **Temporal Logic**: Formal temporal reasoning (always, eventually, until, since)

### 4. Dynamic Benchmark Creation
```python
class TemporalBenchmarkGenerator:
    """Generate benchmarks that test temporal reasoning."""
    
    def create_temporal_variants(self, base_claim: str) -> List[TimedClaim]:
        """Create time-variant versions of claims."""
        pass
    
    def generate_temporal_sequences(self, domain: str) -> List[TemporalSequence]:
        """Generate sequences of time-dependent events."""
        pass
```

## Technical Specifications

### Temporal Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class TemporalCoherenceConfig:
    """Configuration for temporal coherence evaluation."""
    temporal_granularity: str = "day"         # Finest time resolution
    max_temporal_span: timedelta = timedelta(years=100)  # Maximum time range
    enable_causality_check: bool = True       # Check causal relationships
    knowledge_cutoff_aware: bool = True       # Consider model training cutoff
    allow_temporal_uncertainty: bool = True   # Allow "I don't know" for future
    temporal_consistency_threshold: float = 0.7  # Consistency requirement
    enable_real_time_updates: bool = False    # Update with current information
```

### Temporal Result Format
```python
@dataclass
class TemporalResult:
    """Result from temporal coherence evaluation."""
    temporal_consistency: float               # Overall temporal consistency
    temporal_conflicts: List[TemporalConflict]  # Detected conflicts
    causality_coherence: float               # Causal relationship consistency
    temporal_reasoning_quality: float        # Quality of temporal logic
    time_sensitivity_score: float           # How well model handles time
    knowledge_boundary_respect: float       # Respects training cutoff boundaries
    temporal_uncertainty_handling: float    # Appropriate uncertainty for unknowns
    anachronism_detection: float            # Avoiding anachronistic claims
```

### Temporal Conflict Detection
```python
@dataclass
class TemporalConflict:
    """Detected conflict in temporal reasoning."""
    claim1: TimedClaim
    claim2: TimedClaim
    conflict_type: str  # "temporal_order", "causality", "state_change", "knowledge_cutoff"
    severity: float     # How severe the conflict is
    explanation: str    # Human-readable explanation
    suggested_resolution: str  # How to resolve conflict
```

## Temporal Reasoning Types

### 1. Temporal Ordering
```python
def evaluate_temporal_ordering(events: List[TimedEvent]) -> float:
    """Evaluate consistency of temporal event ordering."""
    # Check if events are in correct chronological order
    # Verify cause comes before effect
    # Ensure state changes happen in logical sequence
    pass
```

### 2. Causality Analysis
```python
def evaluate_causal_coherence(causal_claims: List[CausalClaim]) -> float:
    """Evaluate temporal consistency of causal relationships."""
    # Verify causes precede effects
    # Check for causal loops or contradictions
    # Evaluate causal chain consistency
    pass
```

### 3. Knowledge Cutoff Awareness
```python
def evaluate_cutoff_awareness(claim: str, reference_time: datetime, cutoff: datetime) -> float:
    """Evaluate if model appropriately handles knowledge cutoff."""
    # Claims about events after cutoff should show uncertainty
    # Claims about ongoing situations should acknowledge limitations
    # Future predictions should be appropriately tentative
    pass
```

### 4. State Change Tracking
```python
def evaluate_state_changes(entity: str, states: List[TimedState]) -> float:
    """Evaluate consistency of entity state changes over time."""
    # Check for impossible state transitions
    # Verify state change causality
    # Ensure temporal consistency of properties
    pass
```

article_claims = extract_temporal_claims(news_article)
consistency = temporal_evaluator.evaluate_temporal_consistency(
    article_claims, 
    TimeContext(reference_time=datetime.now())
)

if consistency.temporal_consistency < 0.7:

```

### 2. Historical Analysis
```python
# Evaluate AI understanding of historical sequences
historical_claims = [
    TimedClaim("World War II ended", valid_until=datetime(1945, 9, 2)),
    TimedClaim("United Nations was founded", valid_from=datetime(1945, 10, 24))
]

coherence = temporal_evaluator.detect_temporal_conflicts(historical_claims)
# Should show no conflicts - UN founded after WWII ended
```

### 3. Knowledge Cutoff Evaluation
```python
# Test model's awareness of its knowledge limitations
cutoff_evaluator = TemporalCoherenceEvaluator(
    config=TemporalCoherenceConfig(knowledge_cutoff_aware=True)
)

# Ask about events after model's training cutoff
post_cutoff_query = "What happened in the 2024 Olympics?"
result = cutoff_evaluator.evaluate_cutoff_awareness(
    query, 
    reference_time=datetime(2024, 8, 1),
    cutoff=datetime(2023, 4, 1)  # Model's training cutoff
)

# Should show high uncertainty for post-cutoff events
```
