# Ensemble Coherence Implementation Task

## Overview
Implement coherence-guided ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple AI models using coherence scores to improve reliability and detect uncertainty.

## Background
Current ensemble methods typically use simple voting or averaging. Coherence-guided ensembles would use coherence scores to:
- Weight model predictions based on internal consistency
- Detect when models are uncertain (low coherence across responses)
- Dynamically select the most coherent models for each task

## Core Components

### 1. Ensemble Coherence Framework
```python
class EnsembleCoherence:
    """Combine multiple model predictions using coherence weighting."""
    
    def __init__(self, models: List[ModelProvider], coherence_measure: CoherenceMeasure):
        self.models = models
        self.coherence_measure = coherence_measure
    
    def predict_with_coherence(self, prompt: str) -> EnsembleResult:
        """Generate predictions from all models and weight by coherence."""
        pass
    
    def get_coherence_weights(self, responses: List[str]) -> List[float]:
        """Calculate coherence-based weights for ensemble."""
        pass
```

### 2. Coherence-Weighted Voting
- **Multi-Response Coherence**: Generate k responses per model, measure internal coherence
- **Cross-Model Coherence**: Measure coherence between responses from different models
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Weight each model's vote by its coherence score
- **Confidence Estimation**: Use coherence variance to estimate ensemble confidence

### 3. Model Selection by Task Type
```python
class TaskAwareEnsemble:
    """Select best models for different task types based on coherence patterns."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_model_performance = {}  # Track coherence by task type
    
    def select_models_for_task(self, task_type: str) -> List[ModelProvider]:
        """Select subset of models that perform coherently on this task type."""
        pass
```

### 4. Uncertainty Detection
- **Low Coherence Threshold**: Flag when all models have low internal coherence
- **High Disagreement**: Flag when models give coherent but contradictory responses
- **Confidence Intervals**: Use coherence to estimate prediction reliability

2. **Monitoring**: Track ensemble performance and coherence metrics
3. **Optimization**: Efficient parallel model execution

## Technical Specifications

### Ensemble Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class EnsembleConfig:
    """Configuration for ensemble coherence evaluation."""
    coherence_weight: float = 0.6          # Weight of coherence vs raw confidence
    min_coherence_threshold: float = 0.4   # Minimum coherence for inclusion
    max_models_per_ensemble: int = 5       # Limit ensemble size
    require_unanimous: bool = False        # Require all models to agree
    uncertainty_threshold: float = 0.3     # Flag uncertain predictions
    enable_model_selection: bool = True    # Dynamic model selection
```

### Ensemble Result Format
```python
@dataclass
class EnsembleResult:
    """Result from ensemble prediction with coherence analysis."""
    prediction: str                        # Final ensemble prediction
    confidence: float                      # Ensemble confidence score
    coherence_score: float                 # Overall coherence across models
    individual_results: List[ModelResult]  # Per-model results
    coherence_weights: List[float]         # Coherence-based weights used
    uncertainty_flags: List[str]           # Uncertainty indicators
    selected_models: List[str]             # Models used in ensemble
    ensemble_method: str                   # Voting/weighting method used
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Production AI Systems
```python
# Robust prediction with uncertainty detection
ensemble = EnsembleCoherence(models=[gpt4, claude, gemini], coherence_measure=HybridCoherence())
result = ensemble.predict_with_coherence("Complex reasoning question")

if result.uncertainty_flags:
    # Flag for human review
    log_uncertain_prediction(result)
else:
    # Use with confidence
    return result.prediction
```

### 2. Benchmark Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate ensemble vs individual models on benchmarks
evaluator = EnsembleBenchmarkEvaluator(
    benchmarks=["gsm8k", "hellaswag", "mmlu", "fever"],
    models=[model1, model2, model3]
)

results = evaluator.compare_ensemble_vs_individual()
# Shows when ensemble coherence improves over individual models
```

### 3. Model Selection
```python
# Automatically choose best models for each task type
selector = CoherenceModelSelector()
selector.train_on_benchmarks(benchmarks, models)

# For new task, automatically select best model subset
best_models = selector.select_for_task("mathematical_reasoning")
ensemble = EnsembleCoherence(models=best_models)
```
