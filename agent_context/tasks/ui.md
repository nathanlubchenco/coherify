The goal of this task is to create an interactive UI that can be run from localhost.  The main goal is for education and intuition building.  So the focus should be on enabling people to see how the various coherence measures work on specific examples so that they can better understand them.  Work on making this visually appealing, but also very clear.  Enable users to change the example text to see how it changes the coherence.  In addition to this exploratory workbench style UI, it would also be great to display a summary of all the benchmarks we've run and how they do with a baseline, a naive k approach and our coherence k approach. Also want to consider any input you have to make this a compelling user experience for our goals.
