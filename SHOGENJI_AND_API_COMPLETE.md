## 🎛️ Analysis Modes Available

1. **Fast (Semantic only)** - ~0.5s, 2 measures
2. **Balanced (Fast + NLI)** - ~2s, 3 measures  
3. **Complete (All measures)** - ~3s, 3 measures
4. **Advanced (+ Shogenji)** - ~4s, 4 measures ✨ NEW!
5. **API Enhanced** - ~5s, up to 6 measures ✨ NEW!

## 🧠 Shogenji Coherence Details

### **What Was Restored**
- Traditional philosophical coherence measure: `C_S = P(H1 ∧ H2 ∧ ... ∧ Hn) / ∏P(Hi)`
- Normalized using `tanh(log(score)/10)` for intuitive 0-1 scale
- Shows original raw score in tooltips for transparency
- Proper error handling and graceful fallbacks

### **Why It Matters**
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Represents formal coherence theory from philosophy
- **Educational Value**: Helps users understand classical coherence concepts
- **Research Applications**: Essential for comparing with modern NLP approaches
- **Completeness**: Makes Coherify a comprehensive coherence analysis platform
