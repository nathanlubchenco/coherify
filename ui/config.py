        Semantic coherence measures how similar propositions are in meaning by:

        1. **Encoding**: Converting each proposition into a high-dimensional vector using transformer models
        2. **Similarity**: Computing cosine similarity between all proposition pairs
        3. **Aggregation**: Combining pairwise similarities into an overall coherence score

        **Strengths**: Good at detecting topical coherence and semantic relatedness
        **Limitations**: May miss logical contradictions if they're semantically similar
        **Best for**: Content analysis, topic modeling, semantic clustering

        Entailment coherence analyzes logical relationships by:

        1. **NLI Classification**: Using trained models to classify proposition pairs as entailment, contradiction, or neutral
        2. **Scoring**: Converting logical relationships into coherence scores
        3. **Integration**: Combining pairwise judgments into overall coherence

        **Strengths**: Detects contradictions and logical inconsistencies
        **Limitations**: May be sensitive to model training data biases

        Hybrid coherence provides comprehensive analysis by:

        1. **Multi-faceted**: Computing both semantic and entailment coherence
        2. **Weighted Combination**: Balancing different aspects of coherence
        3. **Robust Scoring**: Less sensitive to individual measure limitations

        **Strengths**: More robust and comprehensive than single measures
        **Limitations**: May dilute strong signals from individual measures
        **Best for**: General purpose coherence analysis, balanced evaluation

        "detailed": """
        The Shogenji coherence measure is the classical approach from philosophy:

        1. **Formula**: C_S = P(H1 ‚àß H2 ‚àß ... ‚àß Hn) / ‚àèP(Hi)
        2. **Interpretation**: How much more likely the propositions are together vs independently
        3. **Normalization**: Applied tanh transformation for intuitive 0-1 scale

        **Strengths**: Theoretically grounded, captures probabilistic coherence
        **Limitations**: Can be extremely large, sensitive to probability estimation
        **Best for**: Theoretical analysis, understanding classical coherence theory

        **Note**: Raw Shogenji scores can range from 0 to infinity. We normalize using
        tanh(log(score)/10) to keep values interpretable while preserving ordering.
